## Technical Details

### System Architecture

**3-Layer Hierarchical Control:**

1. **Layer 1: VSM (Fast - Seconds Scale)**
   - Virtual Inertia: k_inertia = 4000 kW/(Hz/s)
   - Droop Control: k_droop = 6000 kW/Hz
   - Responds to frequency deviations and RoCoF

2. **Layer 2: AGC (Medium - Minutes Scale)**
   - Integral gain: k_i = 5.0
   - Back-calculation anti-windup: k_aw = 0.5
   - Restores frequency to 50 Hz

3. **Layer 3: SOC Correction (Slow - Hours Scale)**
   - Proportional gain: k_soc = 1000
   - Target SOC: 50%
   - Prevents battery saturation

### Per-Unit Swing Equation

```
df/dt = (f_nom / 2H) × (ΔP_pu - D_pu × Δf)
```

Where:
- f_nom = 50 Hz (nominal frequency)
- H = 10 seconds (inertia constant)
- D_pu = D / S_base (per-unit damping)
- ΔP_pu = (P_gen - P_load) / S_base

### Battery Control

```python
P_battery = P_vsm + P_agc + P_soc
```

**Specifications:**
- Capacity: 10,000 kWh
- Max Power: 7,000 kW
- Efficiency: 95%
- SOC Range: 10-90%

### Thermal Generator

```python
P_thermal_setpoint = max(0, P_load - MA(P_renewable))
```

**Specifications:**
- Max Power: 5,000 kW
- Ramp Rate: 50 kW/min
- Dispatch: Follows moving average (12 timesteps)
